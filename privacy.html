          Your privacy is important to us. It is reMRKable Dev's policy to
          respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you
          across our website,
          <a href="https://remrkabledev.com/">https://remrkabledev.com/</a>, and
          other sites we own and operate.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
        <h4>Log data</h4>
        <p>
          When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the
          standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your
          computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and
          version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the
          time spent on each page, and other details.
        </p>
        <h4>Device data</h4>
        <p>
          We may also collect data about the device you’re using to access our
          website. This data may include the device type, operating system,
          unique device identifiers, device settings, and geo-location data.
          What we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device
          and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device
          manufacturer or software provider to learn what information they make
          available to us.
        </p>
        <h4>Personal information</h4>
        <p>We may ask for personal information, such as your:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Legal bases for processing</h3>
        <p>
          We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a
          transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only
          where we have legal bases for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them,
          meaning we collect and use your information only where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
            party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a
            contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from
            us);
          </li>
          <li>
            it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
            data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
            market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and
            interests;
          </li>
          <li>
            you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example,
            you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or
          </li>
          <li>
            we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
          purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this
          will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While
          we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially
          acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised
          access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise
          that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure
          and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may
          retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal
          obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
          interests of another natural person.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Collection and use of information</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following
          purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a
          manner that is incompatible with these purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to contact and communicate with you;</li>
          <li>
            for analytics, market research and business development, including
            to operate and improve our website, associated applications and
            associated social media platforms;
          </li>
          <li>
            for advertising and marketing, including to send you promotional
            information about our products and services and information about
            third parties that we consider may be of interest to you; and
          </li>
          <li>
            to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that
            we may have.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
        <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to
            provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service
            providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, ad networks,
            analytics, error loggers, debt collectors, maintenance or
            problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers,
            professional advisors and payment systems operators; and
          </li>
          <li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. International transfers of personal information</h3>
        <p>
          The personal information we collect is stored and processed where we
          or our partners, affiliates and third-party providers maintain
          facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you
          consent to the disclosure to these overseas third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
          countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the
          EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using
          standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission,
          or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
          another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
          jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
          the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
          engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
          laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able
          to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h3>
        <p>

          this personal information to another third party.
        </p>
