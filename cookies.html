        <p>
          We use cookies to help improve your experience of
          <a href="https://remrkabledev.com/">https://remrkabledev.com/</a>.
          This cookie policy is part of reMRKable Dev's privacy policy, and
          covers the use of cookies between your device and our site. We also
          provide basic information on third-party services we may use, who may
          also use cookies as part of their service, though they are not covered
          by our policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your
          browser to refuse cookies from
          <a href="https://remrkabledev.com/">https://remrkabledev.com/</a>,
          with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some
          of your desired content and services.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
          when you visit, typically containing information about the website
          itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
          browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of
          the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track
          site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone,
          notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg.
          advertising, language).
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to
          as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on
          that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie.
          third parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to
          track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
        <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website,
          enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping
          carts and payment processing. We do not use this type of cookie on our
          site.
        </p>
        <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website
          during your visit, without collecting personal information about you.
          Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with
          information tracked across all site users, to help companies
          understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or
          errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions
          in improving their audience’s overall website experience. These
          cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
          third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.
        </p>
        <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your
          device and any settings you may configure on the website you’re
          visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information,
          websites can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised
          content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re
          visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality
          cookies for selected features on our site.
        </p>
        <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional
          content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests.
          Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the
          number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve
          the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content
          presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re
          visiting (first-party) or by third-party services.
          Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to
          track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We
          do not use this type of cookie on our site.
        </p>
        <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
        <p>
          We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our
          websites—for example, analytics providers and content partners. We
          grant these third parties access to selected information to perform
          specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in
          order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies
          can be used to track you on other websites that use the same
          third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies,
          they are not covered by reMRKable Dev's cookie policy.
        </p>
        <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
        <p>
          We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before
          enlisting their services to ensure their practices align with ours. We
          will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or
          violate the privacy of our users.
        </p>
        <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
        <p>
          If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your
          browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are
          configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these
          settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a
          website is trying to set or update a cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update
          your settings on each individual device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your
          experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable
          to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
